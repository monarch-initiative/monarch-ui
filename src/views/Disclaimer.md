  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>
    You are here identified as a recipient of one or more Monarch Initiative
    software and/or data collection tools, including but not limited to the
    Exomiser, (hereby referred to as “Monarch Tools”) developed by Oregon Health
    and Science University ("OHSU"). OHSU provides you the Monarch Tools under
    the following limitations.

  <h4>Use of Hotjar</h4>
  <p>
    This web application tracks user behavior such as navigation and clicks.
    We do this through the use of Hotjar, a background script and service that takes significant steps to remove identifying information from the data
    it collects to ensure anonymity. To learn more about how Hotjar maintains
    privacy and complies with relevant privacy laws,
    <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/legal/compliance/gdpr-commitment/">see their explanation here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, the Monarch Initiative pledges to never inspect or disclose any
    private, identifying information collected by Hotjar, and to only use it for
    the purposes of improving the Monarch web app.

  <h4>Intended use</h4>
  <p>
    MonarchInitiative.org is not intended for direct diagnostic use or medical
    decision-making. If you have any health questions about the information
    contained on this website, please contact a medical professional.
  </p>
  <h4>Variant interpretation</h4>
  <p>
    The Monarch Initiative sources variant interpretations as provided by the
    original source, with no consolidation of results, and always has a link out
    to the original reference. While we display the variants and interpretations
    as originally reported in the variant databases, some variants in the same
    genes have been reported on different transcripts. Whenever possible,
    Monarch will attempt to map all variants in a particular gene to a common
    transcript to aid in viewing and organizing the variants. However, to aid in
    variant searches, we will also continue to report the original mapping
    information. All interpretations were performed by the original submitters
    and have not been modified in any way. As such, there might be discordant
    interpretations for the same variant from different archives. For further
    information or to request a review of the variant, please contact the
    submitter of the original reference. Variant interpretations are not static
    as they are based on the current understanding of the variant at the time it
    was observed in a patient or in the literature. Any reported interpretation
    may not be up-to-date, and some information may not be reported. Many
    interpretations will change over time as more information about the variant
    becomes available. If you have any questions about a variant interpretation
    or would like use any variant interpretations for publication purposes,
    please contact the submitter of the original reference. As always, we value
    your feedback. Please email us if you have any problems, concerns, or
    suggestions.
