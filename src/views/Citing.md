 To cite a specific data page or result in Monarch:
 
 > Because most of the association content in Monarch comes from external sources, we kindly ask that you please cite the original database records (e.g. http://www.informatics.jax.org/accession/MGI:1915196) or the original publications (e.g. PMID:25605924), as appropriate.
 
 If you wish to link from your site to a specific data page from the Monarch Initiative website, or link to algorithmic results as presented in Monarch, please do so using our permalinks (a.k.a. "HTTP URI"). The permalink for each data page starts with the Monarch URL https://monarchinitiative.org/ followed by the entity's prefixed accession (e.g. OMIM:154700); in this example, the permalink would be https://monarchinitiative.org/OMIM:154700.
 
 For example, the suggested citation for this record from OMIM at Monarch Initiative would be as follows:
 Prefixed Identifier: OMIM:154700
 http URI/permalink: https://monarchinitiative.org/OMIM:154700
 Suggested citation: Monarch Consortium. Accessed 2016-09-22. Marfan Syndrome. https://monarchinitiative.org/OMIM:154700

 Please note that the data in Monarch is constantly expanding and improving. The data is versioned with each database release, and archived database releases are available upon request. The evolution of individual records in Monarch is not currently tracked.
