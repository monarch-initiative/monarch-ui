The correlation of\n      phenotypic outcomes and disease with genetic variation and environmental\n      factors is a core pursuit in biology and biomedicine.

We have developed\n      algorithms and tools that are in use by multiple communities for tasks\n      including the identification of animal models of human disease through\n      phenotypic similarity, phenotype-driven computational support for\n      differential diagnostics, and translational research.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-12 col-lg-6\">\n      <figure class=\"cross-species\">\n        <img src=\"../assets/img/phenotype-cov-hum-6.png\">\n        <figcaption class=\"phenotype-coverage\">\n          Fig 1.
